### turtle-graphics

Turtle is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw in a screen. 

There is a turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) which can move the turtle around.

There are alot of other methods and attributes for the turtle object, which can be used to move or do certain tasks with the turtle.

RGB color: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp


This helps to understand how to import python libraries and utilise the classes defined in it. It is also possible to explore various attributes and methods of the classes in the imported library to draw whatever we want using python.

Six different colored turtles start to randomly move from the starting of the screen. 

User asked to guess the color of the winning turtle.

If the color of the first turtle that reaches the end of the screen is same as that of the user's guessed color, then the user won. Otherwise the user lost.
